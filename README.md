 A game for children with a disability

## Assignment
A game for people with a communicative, cognitive and physical disease. Because of these challenges, the game can't have any time sensitive activities, in-game economy, competitive or fast actions. The game should also run on the website of comgames.be(https://www.comgames.be/)

## Game Concept
The game we are going to make is based on 'cookie-clicker'(https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). By clicking the plants, you can grow them (the progress is displayed trough a a statusbar). When you keep clicking the plant you can also see the visuals of the plant change over time until it is fully grown. When a plant is fully grown, you will have the option to create a new plant, just like you would start a new level.
